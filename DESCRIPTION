Title: A libyaml MEX-file interface for Matlab 
Description: Mat-YAML is an interface to LibYAML for Matlab and GNU Octave.
 Mat-YAML is intended to make it easy to convert Matlab structs and vectors to
 and from YAML mappings and sequences. Because the correspondence between these
 types is not perfect (eg, YAML mappings can have arbitrary keys, while Matlab
 structs' field names must be valid Matlab identifiers), this is not always
 possible. But, in many cases, the correspondence is close enough to be useful.
